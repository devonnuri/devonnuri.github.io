//! Thematic break occurs in the [flow][] content type.
//!
//! ## Grammar
//!
//! Thematic break forms with the following BNF
//! (<small>see [construct][crate::construct] for character groups</small>):
//!
//! ```bnf
//! ; Restriction: all markers must be identical.
//! ; Restriction: at least 3 markers must be used.
//! thematic_break ::= *space_or_tab 1*(1*marker *space_or_tab)
//!
//! marker ::= '*' | '-' | '_'
//! ```
//!
//! As this construct occurs in flow, like all flow constructs, it must be
//! followed by an eol (line ending) or eof (end of file).
//!
//! ## HTML
//!
//! Thematic breaks in markdown typically relate to the HTML element `<hr>`.
//! See [*ยง 4.4.2 The `hr` element* in the HTML spec][html] for more info.
//!
//! ## Recommendation
//!
//! It is recommended to use exactly three asterisks without whitespace when
//! writing markdown.
//! As using more than three markers has no effect other than wasting space,
//! it is recommended to use exactly three markers.
//! Thematic breaks formed with asterisks or dashes can interfere with
//! [list][list-item]s if there is whitespace between them: `* * *` and `- - -`.
//! For these reasons, it is recommend to not use spaces or tabs between the
//! markers.
//! Thematic breaks formed with dashes (without whitespace) can also form
//! [heading (setext)][heading_setext].
//! As dashes and underscores frequently occur in natural language and URLs, it
//! is recommended to use asterisks for thematic breaks to distinguish from
//! such use.
//! Because asterisks can be used to form the most markdown constructs, using
//! them has the added benefit of making it easier to gloss over markdown: you
//! can look for asterisks to find syntax while not worrying about other
//! characters.
