//! Blank lines occur in the [flow][] content type.
//!
//! ## Grammar
//!
//! Blank lines form with the following BNF
//! (<small>see [construct][crate::construct] for character groups</small>):
//!
//! ```bnf
//! blank_line ::= *space_or_tab
//! ```
//!
//! As this construct occurs in flow, like all flow constructs, it must be
//! followed by an eol (line ending) or eof (end of file).
//!
//! Blank lines are sometimes needed, such as to differentiate a [paragraph][]
//! from a definition.
//! In several cases, blank lines are not needed between flow constructs,
//! such as between two [heading (atx)][heading_atx]s.
//! Sometimes, whether blank lines are present, changes the behavior of how
//! HTML is rendered, such as whether blank lines are present inside or between
//! [list items][list_item].
//! More than one blank line is never needed in `CommonMark`.
//!
//! Because blank lines can be empty (line endings are not considered part of
//! it), and events cannot be empty, blank lines are not present as an event.
//!
//! ## HTML
//!
//! Blank lines do not relate to an element in HTML, except for the role they
//! play when inside or between [list items][list_item].
//!
//! ## Recommendation
//!
//! It is recommended to always use a blank line between every flow construct,
//! to use blank lines (consistently) between list items as desired, and to
//! never use more than one blank line.
